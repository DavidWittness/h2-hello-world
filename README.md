# Hydrogen template: Hello World

A minimal setup of components, queries and tooling to get started with Hydrogen.

## What's included

- ESLint
- Prettier
- Typescript
- Oxygen

## TODO

- Everything in `lib` folder will maybe need to be abstracted into a shared module
- Rebuild this example with something closer to the release candidate of the hello world template
- Add in basic testing for our own purposes?
- Helpful comments
- Deploy to Gitpod/Stackblitz button?

## Questions

- Should we add tailwind css?
- Should we do bot detection?
- Rename `oxygen.ts` to `server.ts`
